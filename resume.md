Address: 1900 Ullrich Ave, Austin, TX, 78756

My ideal job is one where I utilize modern tools and development practices. Git, Github Flow, and trello for project management, Node.js on the server, Backbone or Angular on the client. Ideally, I would be building single-page web applications backed by RESTful services. I'm currently a full-stack developer, sometimes designer and I want to keep it that way. I want a company culture that empowers myself and my co-workers. A company that integrates itself in the community that supports it.

## Professional Experience

### Web developer and IT Support

Company: Royse City ISD
Date: June 2003 - February 2008

At the end of my sophomore year of high school I was approached by the IT department to work as a technology intern. At $8/hr, this was a lot more appealing than what my peers were doing for work. I endedup designing and developing the district website and managing all of the sub campus web pages. Technologies used:

* Apache
* PHP
* Wordpress
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript
* Photoshop

### Independent Contractor

Company: Sole Proprietor
Date: 2005 - Present

In high school, I realized I could make money from making web pages for small businesses. I have been doing it ever since. Projects range from simple brochure websites, to poster print and graphic design, to digital media signage with automatic updates. A few of the companies that have contracted me are:

* Agency Entourage (http://agencyentourage.com/)
* Culture Farm (http://culturefarm.co/)
* Front Burner Restaurants (http://www.frontburnerbrands.com/)

### Web Developer

Company: Canonball Creative
Website: http://www.canonball.com
Date: March 2008 - December 2009

Coming out of Royse City, I was a self-taught web developer and self-ascribed designer. When I started work for Canonball in 2008, I learned how to work with other people, and more importantly, I met real designers. I did a lot of client work and even some projects that are still live (see http://www.eisenberginc.com/). I realized the vastness of the web community and with that realization came humbleness and humility.

Technologies used:

* Apache
* PHP
* Wordpress
* ModX
* MooTools
* jQuery
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript
* SubVersion
* Photoshop

### Research Assistant

Organization: The University of North Texas - Multimedia Information Group
Professor: Dr. Oh
Date: February 2008 - January 2009

After my 3rd semester in Computer Science at UNT, I was invited to help the Multimedia Information Group (MIG) with its research. At UNT, each research group is required to have two undergraduates. My CS3 professor recommended me to work with MIG because of my previous experience working with the web. My duties ranged from creating the group website, publishing results, running image processing benchmarks, and even writing a few lines of C++. Primarily, I was tasked with the public-facing website and publishing results.

Technologies used:

* Apache
* Linux
* PHP
* Wordpress
* SubVersion
* C++
* CUDA

### Software Developer

Company: ENRG Consultants
Website: http://www.enrgconsultants.com
Date: May 2008 - Present

Admittedly, this was originally a contract position that turned into full-time and is now back in contract mode, but I would rather have this position on its own. While I was in college, I was approached by Todd Boring, owner of ENRG. He asked me if it was possible to automate the work he was currently doing and to make his product real-time and on the web. Being an eager college student, I said, "of course."

I developed and helped research the noise-monitoring solution ENRG provides for the oil, gas, and construction industries. Back in 2008, I was awful at design and their website and product reflects that. However, a new version is in the works. The point is, in 2008, I wrote a bunch of software that is still in use and supporting a company today.

Technologies Used (over the years):

* Apache
* PHP
* MySQL
* C# ASP.Net
* MsSQL
* Node.js
* Postgres

### Systems Administrator and Software Developer

Company: Dallas Regional Medical Center
Corporate: Health Management Associates
Website: http://www.dallasregionalmedicalcenter.com
Date: December 2011 - Present

Going to a more corporate environment was a move I thought might make me more comfortable as compared to the chaos of school and contract work. The position asked for someone with Windows Sys Admin skills, web software development, and graphic design prowess. The band of job requirements was appealing. While I was there, I worked on:

* The company Intranet
* Various print media (company posters, table tents, handbooks, etc.)
* Weirdly, I ran the Photo Studio for doctor portraits
* Built custom Active Directory user search interfaces
* Built custom AS400 user search interfaces

I worked hard for a year and realized it was not inline with my goals. Although, I am technically still employed by Health Management Associates, I worked out a deal with them so that I only come in when I am absolutely needed.

Technologies used:

* PHP
* C#
* Batch scripting
* Photoshop

### Software Engineer

Company: Goodybag
Website: http://goodybag.com
Date: December 2012 - Present

When I was approached to join a startup in Austin, TX, I jumped on the opportunity. I had heard that living and breathing the startup culture was a necessity in the software field, so I did it. The emotional and educational ride has been rewarding. My responsibilities at goodybag include:

* Handling all front-end development
* Develop HTML5/PhoneGap Mobile app
* Develop Titanium Mobile app
* Build node.js/expres.js REST API
* Implement ElasticSearch

I learned at Goodybag. Not just about software, but about culture. About the power of community and open source. About empowering employees to affect the companies they work for.

Technoloes used:

* Node.js
* Nginx
* Heroku
* Postgres
* MongoDB
* Express.js
* Mongoose
* Handlebars
* Backbone.js
